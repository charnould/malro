## TL;DR

Cultural operators are experts at organizing events and exhibitions, but they might have less experience building apps. MALRO (pronounced `/mal-ROH/`) lets them publish **freely**, **quickly**, **once**, **worldwide** and in an **open** way their events (while staying forever in **full control**), and developers freely consume these data to **build innovative services**.

At its core, MALRO is 5 simple things:

- A **simple**, **open** and **interoperable data format** that describes in a multilingual way cultural events and associated metadata like schedules, description, location, etc.

- An **open and downloadable database** where live worldwide, standardized and up-to-date cultural events data (aka MALRO event).

- A **public and no-auth `SQLite API`** allowing anyone to consume MALRO data and build innovative services.

- An **open source app** allowing cultural operators to generate, validate and freely host MALRO events.

- A **widget** allowing anyone to embed anywhere any MALRO event (or custom feed) as simply as you embed a YouTube video or a Tweet.

## Questions

For questions, please use the [discussion list](https://github.com/charnould/malro/discussions). The issue list of this repo is exclusively code and translation-related.

## Contributions

Healthy criticism, discussion and suggestions for improvements are more than welcome.

Feel free to contribute. You can help:

- improve code, tools and copywriting
- translate MALRO (only french and english are currently available)
- The BIG One â€” evangelize MALRO to cultural operators and public authorities.

## MALRO format

### Guiding principles

In order to preserve the vision of MALRO, some guiding principles have been established to take into consideration when modifying or extending the format:

- **Speculative features are discouraged**  
  Every new feature adds complexity to the creation and reading of feeds. Therefore, MALRO want to take care to only add features that we know to be useful.

- **MALRO event should be easy to create and edit**  
  We chose `json` as the basis for the format because it's easy to manipulate for developers. It's also pretty straightforward to generate, which is good for publishers of larger feeds.

- **MALRO event should be easy to parse**  
  Event readers should be able to extract the information they're looking for with as little work as possible. Changes and additions to MALRO event should be as broadly useful as possible, to minimize the number of code paths that readers of MALRO event need to implement.

- **The format is about citizen information**  
  MALRO is primarily concerned with citizen information. That is, the format should include information that can help power tools for citizen, first and foremost. There is potentially a large amount of operations-oriented information that cultural operators might want to transmit internally between systems. MALRO is not intended for that purpose.

### Specification: What's a MALRO event?

A MALRO event is a single `json` object that describes a **unique cultural event** that occurs **one or multiple times** in the very **same location**. It contains everything that describes a cultural event including location, description and calendar.

> Examples: permanent collections of a Museum are described in 1 MALRO event. The same for a 3-time concert in the same hall. However, the same event occuring in 6 different places needs 6 MALRO events.

## MALRO open data

### MALRO database model

MALRO database/archive contains several tables:

- `events`: MALRO events with a data model aligned with [MALRO format](#specification-whats-a-malro-event)
- `calendar`: convenient denormalization of `events.calendar`
- `linked_to`: convenient denormalization of `events.linked_to`

**Note:** MALRO uses another database (called `users.db`) handling `users` and event `drafts`. This database is not public.

### Download MALRO database

#### Event data

MALRO SQLite Database is open, free to use and downloadable at this URL: https://malro.org/datastore/archives/yyyy-mm-dd.db.gz where `yyyy-mm-dd` stands for a date (e.g. `2023-07-01`). At this time, backup is featherweight (ðŸ˜…) and done at 23:45 (GMT).

#### Event images

- **thumbnails** are available at https://malro.org/datastore/images/uuid.webp where `uuid` stands for event `id`. Image size is `636` (widht) x `340` (height) pixels and format `webp`.
- **originals** are available at https://malro.org/datastore/images/originals/uuid.webp where `uuid` stands for event `id`. Image format is `webp`.

### MALRO public SQLite API

MALRO provides a public, no-auth and free to use `API` to query database. This `API` is `GET`-only and doesn't perform any action other than delivering readonly `json` or `html` event.

`API` is accessible at https://malro.org/sql/query?format=json where:

- `query` is a valid `encodeURI()` `SELECT` SQLite statement.
- `format` query string parameter is set to `json` (if omitted, it will return a [MALRO widget](#malro-widget)).

**Please:** Do not bring down MALRO, add a `LIMIT` or paginate your query.

> Examples:  
> A [simple query](<https://malro.org/sql/select%20*,%20min(start)%20as%20next%20from%20calendar%20inner%20join%20events%20using%20(id)%20inner%20join%20linked_to%20using%20(id)%20where%20status='published'%20and%20linked_to.domain='jubilons.org'%20and%20calendar.start%3Estrftime('%25Y-%25m-%25d',%20'now')%20group%20by%20id%20order%20by%20next%20limit%201?format=json>) returning a particular `json` event.  
> The [same query](<https://malro.org/sql/select%20*,%20min(start)%20as%20next%20from%20calendar%20inner%20join%20events%20using%20(id)%20inner%20join%20linked_to%20using%20(id)%20where%20status='published'%20and%20linked_to.domain='jubilons.org'%20and%20calendar.start%3Estrftime('%25Y-%25m-%25d',%20'now')%20group%20by%20id%20order%20by%20next%20limit%201>) returning an `html` response.

### MALRO enums translations

MALRO event contains a few public-facing enums (e.g. `type`, `feature`). Translations of theses enums are available and free to use at [`locales/enums`](locales/enums). Feel free to help translating.

### Daily MALRO database purge

In order to keep MALRO database clean, MALRO will purge every day at 01:00 (GMT) the `events` table of all events marked as `trashed` or `spam` 10 days ago or before. Note that `calendar` and `linked_to` tables are purged in realtime at `status` change.

That means that developers mirroring MALRO database must do it frequently to keep their data in sync.

## MALRO widget

MALRO widget allows anyone to embed anywhere for free an event (or a custom feed) in the same way you embed a YouTube video or a Tweet.

This widget is accessible at https://malro.org/sql/query?format=001 where:

- `query` is a valid `encodeURI()` `SELECT` SQLite statement
- (optional) `format` query string parameter is set to `001` (default to `001`).  
  This corresponds to widget original version.
- (optional) `embed` query string parameter is set to `true` or `false` (default to `false`).  
  It displays or not sharing link and code to embed widget.
- (optional) `referral` query string parameter is an `encodeURI()` `<a href="..." style="...">link</a>`.  
  It displays this link (`embed` must be `false` or omitted).
